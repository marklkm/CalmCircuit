## 🧠 For Clinicians or Researchers

**Calm Circuit** is designed as a non-invasive, educational tool to demonstrate vagal tone regulation concepts through behavioural strategies such as paced breathing, humming, and grounding.  
It does not measure physiological signals or deliver stimulation.

### Clinical Relevance

- Supports psychoeducation on autonomic regulation and the parasympathetic nervous system.
- Encourages mindful interoception, self-regulation, and relaxation strategies.
- Can complement therapy or occupational interventions when used with appropriate supervision.
- May assist in teaching about vagal tone, breath control, and nervous system resilience.
